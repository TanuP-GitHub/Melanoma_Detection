## General Information
- general information about project - To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. We build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.
- 
- the business probem that our project is trying to solve - A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- 
- dataset that is being used - The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Technologies Used
- Python version 3

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 - 1st model with 32 layers was that there was issue of overfitting
- Conclusion 2 - 2nd model by using dropout and overfitting was not resolved yet
- Conclusion 3 - 3rd model built using Data Augmentation by class imbalancing and could acheive accuracy more but overfitting was still present
- Conclusion 4 - disease name 'pigmented benign keratosis' had maximum number and least were of 'vascular lesion'
